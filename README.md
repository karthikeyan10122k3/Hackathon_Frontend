# National-Level Hackathon Project - Textile Website

This project was developed as part of a national-level hackathon hosted at Sri Kalasalingam University. Our team created a textile website aimed at facilitating textile purchases integrated with Blockchain, allowing users to select manufacturers for their textiles.

I was responsible for developing the frontend of the website.
