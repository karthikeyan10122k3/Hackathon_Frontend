              Textile is an umbrella term that includes various fiber-based
              materials, including fibers, yarns, filaments, threads, different
              fabric types, etc. At first, the word "textiles" only referred to
              woven fabrics.However, weaving is not the only manufacturing
              method, and many other methods were later developed to form
              textile structures based on their intended use. Knitting and
              non-woven are other popular types of fabric manufacturing. In the
              contemporary world, textiles satisfy the material needs for
              versatile applications, from simple daily clothing to bulletproof
              jackets, spacesuits, and doctor's gowns

              Textiles themselves are too fragile to survive across millennia;
              the tools used for spinning and weaving make up most of the
              prehistoric evidence for textile work. The earliest tool for
              spinning was the spindle, to which a whorl was eventually added.
              The weight of the whorl improved the thickness and twist of the
              spun thread. Later, the spinning wheel was invented. Historians
              are unsure where; some say China, others India. The precursors of
              today's textiles include leaves, barks, fur pelts, and felted
              cloths The Banton Burial Cloth, the oldest existing example of
              warp ikat in Southeast Asia, is displayed at the National Museum
              of the Philippines. The cloth was most likely made by the native
              Asian people of northwest Romblon.

              Textiles are all around us. The textile is a component of basic
              needs like food and shelter. Textiles are everywhere in our lives,
              from bath towels to space suits. Textiles help humans by
              comforting, protecting, and extending their lives. Textiles meet
              our clothing needs, keeping us warm in the winter and cool in the
              summer. There are several applications for textiles, such as
              medical textiles, intelligent textiles, and automotive textiles.
              All of them contribute to the well-being of humans
